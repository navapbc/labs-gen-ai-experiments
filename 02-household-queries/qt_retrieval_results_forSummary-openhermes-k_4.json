The client is married and they have two adult kids and then two foster kids. The client's mother lives with them and they have a live in attendant who takes care of her. One of the kids is 20 and in college full time. He's not working and comes home on summer and winter breaks. I think he's an ineligible student, but does he still need to be listed on the application, would he be included in the summer? Their other child is 23 and buys some of his own food, but will eat when his mother cooks a big dinner. The foster kids are 11 and 12. They eat with them, so I think they need to be included? The client's mother has special food needs so her live in attendant cooks for her separately and they eat together. She also wants to apply. How do I enter this?",
