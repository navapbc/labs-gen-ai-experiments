    Search V2

    Returns service-at-location search results from the 211 National Data Platform's resource repository search index and values that can be used to filter search results.  A common use case for this API is to return a list of abbeviated service at location resources (i.e. search results) using the '/keyword' endpoint, then use values from within the search results to retrieve the details for a selected service-at-location resource using the 'query/service-at-location-details' endpoint on the Query V2 API.  The Search V2 API organizes operations into two categories:  * Search: returns a list of abbreviated service-at-location resources (i.e. search results) from a GET or POST request that can be configured to filter results using operation parameters, such as tags, service areas, taxonomy terms, etc. The Search operations can also be configured to return facets for targeting specific resources in downstream searches, selecting fields used for search, and setting the type of geographic search filter (e.g. filter results using the geographic boundary of a location or distance between the target and the service location). The Search operation supports two methods: GET and POST. The GET method is intended as a basic method compared to the POST method, providing a streamlined approach to searching resources. The POST method, although less simple to implement compared to the GET method, provides a more flexible and configurable approach to managing the request to, and response from the Search operation. Both methods include default values on several query string parameters and request body content fields. Refer to the documentation for more details   * Filters: provides values for parameters used in API operations. As an example, use the 'filters/tags' operation to retrieve a list of values that can be passed as an argument to the Tags filter on the 'search/keyword' POST operation.  HINT: Get started quickly... use the GET search/keyword API operation to retrieve search results, then pass the idServiceAtLocation value from a search result to the 'query/service-at-location-details' operation on the Query V2 API operation to return details on the service at location resource.   The Search API is often used with the Query V2 API and Suggest V2 API to implement use cases. The Query V2 API returns details of specific resources from the NDP resource repository, such as a service at location, service, location and organization. As an example, 'search/keyword' operation returns results with the ID for a service-at-location that that can be passed as an argument to the Query V2 API 'query/service-at-location-details' operation to retrieve the details, such as eligibility, hours of operation, etc, of a service-at-location resource. The Suggest V2 API provides type-ahead functionality that returns values for suggested keyword and location terms, scoped to parameter values such as 'dataOwners' and location types to enhance the user search experience and improve/narrow the quality of search results.   See the Query and Suggest API documentation for more details.
